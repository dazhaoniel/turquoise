# Turquoise Classification

Fine-tuning for Turquoise Classification with ðŸ¤— Transformers.

I love turquoises and a trip earlier this year to [The Turquoise Museum](https://turquoisemuseum.com/) in Albuquerque inspired this project.

The fine tuned model is currently hosted at [https://huggingface.co/dzhao114/generated_models](https://huggingface.co/dzhao114/generated_models). Future plans include adding more training data, switching to use `google/vit-base-patch16-224` base model and deploying this model to a streamlit app.
