# Turquoise Classification

Fine-tuning for Turquoise Classification with ðŸ¤— Transformers.

I love turquoises and a trip earlier this year to [The Turquoise Museum](https://turquoisemuseum.com/) in Albuquerque inspired this project. I got the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadmuzamil5500/gemstones/).

The fine tuned model is currently hosted at [https://huggingface.co/dzhao114/vit-base-patch16-224-finetuned-turquoise](https://huggingface.co/dzhao114/vit-base-patch16-224-finetuned-turquoise). I only have about 1000 labeled images for fine tuning and I'm looking for more images to improve it, let me know if you want to collaborate ðŸ˜Š
